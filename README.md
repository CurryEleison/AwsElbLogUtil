# AwsElbLogUtil
A library to help with downloading and parsing log files from Amazon Web Services
Elasitc Load Balancer (ELB).

There is much scope for improvement here, but you'd like to use it write me and
I'll make it more generally usable. 

Methods mostly expect you to be in a role where you have permissions to download
the log files.
